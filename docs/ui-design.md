## UI Design

In the beginning phase of development, I started thinking about how UI should look like. After understanding challenge and definitions, I started my assumptions which I listed in [separate doc](./assumptions.md).

The initial design is very basic and then I modified as I went ahead in thinking process. So without talking and writing more, I will upload photos of my whiteboard!

That shows how I thought and how is UI flow in the app.

It's not 100% similar to implementation but I tried to follow. But during implementaion also new idea or improvement thought came, so that can be different from images here!
